# Documentation Map

This file is the entry point for project documentation collaboration with AI.

## Canonical documents (single source of truth)

- Writing and manuscript governance: `docs/AI_WRITING_REFERENCE.md`
- Paper scaffold and section layout: `paper/README.md`
- Figure plan and placeholders: `paper/figures/FIGURE_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- LaTeX build workspace: `paper/latex/README.md`
- Fixed pipeline operation handbook: `sim_flip/PIPELINE_OPERATION_GUIDE.md`
- Legacy-to-fixed pipeline mapping: `sim_flip/README_MIGRATION.md`

## Usage rules

- When two docs conflict, follow the canonical doc for that domain.
- Keep one topic in one canonical document; avoid copying the same rules into multiple files.
- Historical working notes and temporary caches are removed from active docs to reduce ambiguity.
