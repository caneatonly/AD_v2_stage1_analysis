Highlights
- Mission-oriented self-suspending platform for corner-reflector deployment
- 3-DOF anisotropic permeability-corrected dynamics with interpretable coupling terms
- CFD used as a model-evidence bridge for static coefficient mapping and CP migration
- Free-decay ID with protocolized splits and out-of-sample sim-real evaluation
- Sensitivity envelopes for design margins and deployment strategy selection
