Highlights
- Mission-oriented self-suspending platform for underwater marker deployment
- Interpretable 3-DOF anisotropic permeability-corrected dynamics model
- CFD-based mapping for force, moment, and pressure-center migration evidence
- Free-decay identification with split-controlled sim-real validation
- Sensitivity envelopes support robust deployment-strategy selection
