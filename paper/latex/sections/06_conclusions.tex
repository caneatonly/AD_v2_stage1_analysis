\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Main Findings}

This study presents a mission-oriented platform-model workflow for the horizontal-launch to vertical-stabilization phase, combining platform configuration, anisotropic permeability-corrected dynamics, CFD-supported hydrodynamic closure, and protocolized parameter determination.

\subsection{Engineering Implications}

Validation and parametric analysis provide design-oriented guidance for deployment operation, including condition sensitivity and operating-region interpretation under the calibrated model package.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

Conclusions are limited to the current geometry, mass distribution, and actuation strategy. Future research directions include expanded condition coverage, deeper uncertainty quantification, and closed-loop depth-control integration beyond the current transition-phase scope.
