\section{Parametric study and design implications}

\subsection{Initial-condition envelope}
The initial-condition envelope is scanned to identify success/failure regions for transition completion, stall risk, and roll-over tendency.

\subsection{Actuation timing analysis}
Shutdown-angle sweeps are compared against always-on strategy, with response time, overshoot, terminal rate, and safety displacement indicators.

\subsection{Buoyancy and damping sensitivity}
Sensitivity to BG variation and damping uncertainty is quantified to derive practical design margins and degradation trends.
