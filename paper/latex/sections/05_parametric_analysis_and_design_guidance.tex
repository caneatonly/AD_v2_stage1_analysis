\section{Parametric Analysis and Design Guidance}

\subsection{Initial-Condition Envelope}

The initial-condition envelope is evaluated to identify success and failure regions for transition completion, stall risk, and roll-over tendency.

\subsection{Actuation Timing Effects}

Shutdown-angle sweeps are compared with the always-on strategy using response time, overshoot, terminal rate, and safety displacement indicators.

\subsection{Sensitivity to BG and Damping}

Sensitivity to $BG$ variation and damping uncertainty is analyzed to establish engineering design margins and performance trends.

\subsection{Recommended Operating Region}

Based on envelope and sensitivity outcomes, this section defines a recommended operating region for deployment-oriented operation. Recommendations are reported as bounded guidance under the current geometry, mass distribution, and actuation strategy, rather than as universal optimal policies.
