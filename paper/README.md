# Paper Scaffold

This directory is the lightweight manuscript scaffold for the fixed pipeline.

- `sections/` keeps manuscript section drafts (including `00_abstract.md`).
- `figures/` stores exported paper-ready figures from scripts.
- `tables/` stores exported tables.

Current section files:

- `00_abstract.md`
- `01_introduction.md`
- `02_system_and_mission_scenario.md`
- `03_anisotropic_permeability_corrected_dynamics.md`
- `04_cfd_to_model_mapping_and_validation.md`
- `05_parameter_identification_free_decay.md`
- `06_sim_real_validation.md`
- `07_sensitivity_and_design_implications.md`
- `08_conclusion_and_outlook.md`

The scaffold is intentionally minimal and data-driven. Update figures/tables by rerunning pipeline scripts.
