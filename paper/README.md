# Paper Scaffold

This directory is the lightweight manuscript scaffold for the fixed pipeline.

- `sections/` keeps section templates.
- `figures/` stores exported paper-ready figures from scripts.
- `tables/` stores exported tables.

The scaffold is intentionally minimal and data-driven. Update figures/tables by rerunning pipeline scripts.
