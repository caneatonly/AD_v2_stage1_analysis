# 5. Parametric Analysis and Design Guidance

## 5.1 Initial-Condition Envelope

The initial-condition envelope is evaluated to identify success and failure regions for transition completion, stall risk, and roll-over tendency.

## 5.2 Actuation Timing Effects

Shutdown-angle sweeps are compared with the always-on strategy using response time, overshoot, terminal rate, and safety displacement indicators.

## 5.3 Sensitivity to BG and Damping

Sensitivity to \(BG\) variation and damping uncertainty is analyzed to establish engineering design margins and performance trends.

## 5.4 Recommended Operating Region

Based on envelope and sensitivity outcomes, this section defines a recommended operating region for deployment-oriented operation. Recommendations are reported as bounded guidance under the current geometry, mass distribution, and actuation strategy, rather than as universal optimal policies.
