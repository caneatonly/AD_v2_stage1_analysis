# 6. Parametric study and design implications

## 6.1 Initial-condition envelope

The initial-condition envelope is scanned to identify success/failure regions for transition completion, stall risk, and roll-over tendency.

## 6.2 Actuation timing analysis

Shutdown-angle sweeps are compared against always-on strategy, with response time, overshoot, terminal rate, and safety displacement indicators.

## 6.3 Buoyancy and damping sensitivity

Sensitivity to `BG` variation and damping uncertainty is quantified to derive practical design margins and degradation trends.
