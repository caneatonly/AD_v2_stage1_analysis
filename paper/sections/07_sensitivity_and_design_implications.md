# 7. Sensitivity and Design Implications

## 7.1 Initial-Energy Envelope and Phase Portraits

The initial-condition envelope is scanned to identify success/failure regions for transition completion, stall risk, and roll-over tendency.

## 7.2 Thrust Timing and Energy Cutoff Strategy

Shutdown-angle sweeps are compared against always-on strategy, with response time, overshoot, terminal rate, and safety displacement indicators.

## 7.3 BG and Damping Robustness

Sensitivity to `BG` variation and damping uncertainty is quantified to derive practical design margins and degradation trends.
