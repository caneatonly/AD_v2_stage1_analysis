# 4. CFD-based hydrodynamic characterization

## 4.1 Simulation setup and methodology

CFD is used as a mechanism and coefficient evidence layer for static hydrodynamic mappings and model-term replacement logic.

## 4.2 Mesh independence and convergence

Mesh independence and residual-convergence summaries are reported to establish numerical reliability for the coefficient tables used by the dynamics module.

## 4.3 Hydrodynamic coefficients

Full-angle mappings of `C_X(alpha)`, `C_Z(alpha)`, and `C_m(alpha)` are presented, including zoom-in panels for high-angle regions where transition dynamics are most sensitive.

## 4.4 Pressure-center migration

`X_cp(alpha)` is analyzed with static stable/unstable region annotations to support moment interpretation during large-attitude transition.

## 4.5 Flow visualization

Selected flow and pressure snapshots at key angles are provided as qualitative mechanism evidence.
