# 4. CFD-to-Model Mapping and Validation

## 4.1 CFD Role in the Evidence Chain

CFD is used as a mechanism and coefficient evidence layer for static hydrodynamic mappings and model-term replacement logic.

## 4.2 Credibility Summary

Mesh independence and residual-convergence summaries are reported to establish numerical reliability for the coefficient tables used by the dynamics module.

## 4.3 Coefficient Mapping Across Angle of Attack

Full-angle mappings of `C_X(alpha)`, `C_Z(alpha)`, and `C_m(alpha)` are presented, including zoom-in panels for high-angle regions where transition dynamics are most sensitive.

## 4.4 Pressure-Center Migration and Stability Interpretation

`X_cp(alpha)` is analyzed with static stable/unstable region annotations to support moment interpretation during large-attitude transition.

## 4.5 Representative Flow-Field Snapshots

Selected flow and pressure snapshots at key angles are provided as qualitative mechanism evidence.
