# 5. Parameter Identification from Free-Decay Tests

## 5.1 Protocol and Data Governance

This section documents preprocessing, segmentation, condition-level split constraints, and anti-leakage rules under `id_protocol.yaml` and `experiment_manifest.csv`.

## 5.2 Joint Identification Workflow

The workflow includes robust fitting, multi-start optimization, and optional bootstrap confidence analysis over selected segments.

## 5.3 Diagnostic Outputs and Confidence

Residual checks, convergence behavior, and bootstrap confidence intervals are reported to evaluate parameter identifiability and stability.
