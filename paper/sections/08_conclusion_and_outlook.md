# 8. Conclusion and Outlook

This section will summarize validated findings from platform design, anisotropic permeability-corrected dynamics, and the identification-to-validation evidence chain. Limitations for geometry/configuration specificity will be restated. Future work will focus on closed-loop depth control and extended mission scenarios beyond the current transition phase.
